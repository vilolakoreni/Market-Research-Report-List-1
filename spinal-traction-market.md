<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spinal Traction Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Spinal Traction</li><li>Mechanical Spinal Traction</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The spinal traction market encompasses two primary types: manual and mechanical spinal traction. Manual spinal traction involves a therapist applying careful physical force to elongate the spine and relieve pressure on spinal nerves and discs. This hands-on approach often enhances flexibility and reduces pain. In contrast, mechanical spinal traction utilizes specialized devices or machines to apply consistent tension across the spine, allowing for precise control and sustained treatment. Both methods aim to alleviate back pain and promote spinal alignment.</p></p>
