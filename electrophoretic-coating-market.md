<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrophoretic Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anodic Electrophoretic Coating</li><li>Cathodic Electrophoretic Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electrophoretic coating, or e-coating, is a process where electrically charged particles are deposited onto a conductive surface. There are two main types: Anodic Electrophoretic Coating and Cathodic Electrophoretic Coating. In anodic e-coating, the workpiece acts as the anode, attracting negatively charged particles, commonly used for decorative finishes. Cathodic e-coating involves the workpiece as the cathode, attracting positively charged particles, offering superior corrosion resistance, making it ideal for automotive and industrial applications. Both methods provide uniform, durable coatings with excellent adhesion and coverage.</p></p>
